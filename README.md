###Finish Tutorial

Touch on things like views and templating.

> views_server.js

Express is pretty dope.

###Add server with Express routing

Going over `app.all` and `app.get` as well as routing with params.

> routing_server.js

Accidentally switched `req` and `res` for an added 10 min bonus of debugging.

###Setup basic Express server

A basic Express server with logging middleware.

> express_server.js

###Setup basic server

A very basic Node server with very basic routing.

> node_server.js

Realized Node doesn't support as much ES6 as I thought...

###Initial commit

Just getting all the ducks in a row
